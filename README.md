# Cpp - Memory Game

I made this project in c++. Basic idea behind this game is that you have to find all duos of numbers from 1 to 20 hidden in a grid. You can view all hidden duos with respect to no of hears you have.

## levels :- This game consists of 3 levels i.e easy, medium and hard.

Hope you will enjoy the game
